### Statistics and Trends

It has been a crazy year for bots, every big tech player in the industry is in the move. We didn’t see a killer bot yet but at least we are experimenting and building new patterns and hopefully we are going to get into the so called “The Chatbot Era”.

After thousands of bots created across different platforms (Slack, Messenger, Telegram, Kik…), i wanted to make it easier for everyone to get an overview of the bot stores out there in terms of supported platforms and number of bots listed on every platform.

Based on your bot’s platform, you will know at glance where you can list your bot and why 🙂

I’ll try of course to keep this [list up–to–date](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gFLLs6jxJl8YDIvarJzupzpNVSPBHMVqiGNeX6J0aNo/edit#gid=0) as much as possible
